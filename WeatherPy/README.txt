WeatherPy-API Homework

In this example, creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this,
i am utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API.

Objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
1. Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
2. Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
3. Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
4. Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


Below are the three observable trends based on the data:

1. As latitude increase or decreases from around the 0-20 degree range of latitudes,the temperature decreases. 

2. In particular 20-40 degrees, appears to be the most humid part of the world.

3. No matter where you are, on any given day, it could be cloudy. 

4. No matter where you are, on any given day,the average wind speed is observed between 0 to 15 (mph).
